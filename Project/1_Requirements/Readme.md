# 1 About Vehicle Monitoring System

# 1.1 Description

Monitoring is one of the principal matters of our project. In this technology, it's miles used to decide the presence of the passenger and if the passenger exists then our machine begins offevolved the functionality. So in recent times the whole thing is turning into computerized and all people is searching out new merchandise to make lifestyles easier. In our project, the principle intention is to layout and broaden a machine this is able to tracking the passenger's life and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.

# Features
