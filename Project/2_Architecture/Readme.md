# 1.2 SENSOR

# Temperature sensor (Thermistor or Heat sensor

* Thermistors are a very accurate and cost- effective sensor for measuring temperature.it is the NTC thermistor that is commonly used to measure temperature
* resistence produces change in voltage, this voltage is taken as input to micro controller.

# 1.3 ACTUATORS

# LCD Display

* Displays the values of temperature

# 1.4 MICRO CONTROLLER

*  An integrated circuit that contains a microprocessor along with memory and associated circuits and that controls the whole system

# 2 Architecture
