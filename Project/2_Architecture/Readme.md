# 1.2 SENSOR

# Temperature sensor (Thermistor or Heat sensor

* Thermistors are a very accurate and cost- effective sensor for measuring temperature.it is the NTC thermistor that is commonly used to measure temperature
* Resistence produces change in voltage, this voltage is taken as input to micro controller.

# 1.3 ACTUATORS

# LCD Display
* Displays the values of room temperature

# LED
* A light-emitting diode is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it

# 1.4 MICRO CONTROLLER
*  An integrated circuit that contains a microprocessor along with memory and associated circuits and that controls the whole system. 
*  Here I am using ATmega-328 cotroller as part of project requirement.

# 1.5 Power Supply
* The DC Power supply powers Microcontroller and other components in the system. Here I am using 5V Dc supply to power the circuit.

# 1.6 Push Button Switch
* Push button switch is connected to the microcontroller through a switch inorde to limit the flowing current.
