# Weight Sensor
* Weight Sensor is another term for a load cell
* It will convert weight into Electrical Signal which can be processed and used in various applications

# LCD
* A liquid crystal display is the most common display type among mobile phones because of its low power consumption and good image quality.
* They are generally easy to read, even under direct sunlight.

# DC Motor
* A type of servomotor that uses DC electrical input to generate mechanical output like velocity, acceleration or position is known as DC servomotor. 
* It is somewhat similar to a normal DC motor. Basically, DC servomotors of all types are required to be excited individually
* Here as a part of requirments I am using two types of Motors DC servo motor for driving the load and DC series motor is used as conveyor motor for driving dispossble waste.

# Relay
* Relays are generally used to switch smaller currents in a control circuit and do not usually control power consuming devices except for small motors and Solenoids that draw low amperes of current.

# Micro Controller
* A microcontroller is embedded inside of a system to control a singular function in a device.
* It does this by interpreting data it receives from its I/O peripherals using its central processor

# Rectifier
*A rectifier is an electrical device that converts alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, to direct current (DC), which flows in only one direction. 
*The reverse operation is performed by the inverter. The process is known as rectification, since it "straightens" the direction of current.

# Power Supply
* A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. 
* The main purpose of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage, current, and frequency to power the load.
* As part of project requirements we are using both 230 V AC and 12 V DC Supply.

# Voltage Regulator
* voltage regulator, any electrical or electronic device that maintains the voltage of a power source within acceptable limits. 
* The voltage regulator is needed to keep voltages within the prescribed range that can be tolerated by the electrical equipment using that voltage.
# C

# Barcode Scanner
*A barcode scanner is an optical scanner that can read printed barcodes, decode the data contained in the barcode and send the data to a computer. 
*Like a flatbed scanner, it consists of a light source, a lens and a light sensor translating for optical impulses into electrical signals.

# Weight Sensor
* Weight Sensor converts an input mechanical force such as load, weight, tension, compression, or pressure into another physical variable, in this case, into an electrical output signal that can be measured, converted and standardized. 
* As the force applied to the sensor increases, the electrical signal changes proportionally.
